# BrounHall Headless

Version 0.1.0 — foundation scaffold.

This project-owned plugin is the WordPress-side foundation for BrounHall's headless architecture. It provides a deterministic bootstrap for future CMS integration while keeping content, presentation, and frontend concerns separate.

## Requirements

- WPGraphQL
- Advanced Custom Fields FREE
- WPGraphQL for ACF
- WPGraphQL Smart Cache

These plugins are expected to provide the underlying integrations; this foundation does not bundle or enforce them.

## Modules

- `content-types.php` — future content type registrations
- `taxonomies.php` — future taxonomy registrations
- `graphql.php` — future GraphQL integration
- `settings.php` — future project settings integration
- `navigation.php` — future navigation integration
- `seo.php` — future SEO integration
- `preview.php` — future preview integration
- `revalidation.php` — future revalidation integration
- `security.php` — future security integration

No module currently implements business behavior.

## Intentionally not implemented

This release does not include custom post types, taxonomies, ACF field groups, GraphQL fields or persisted queries, navigation logic, SEO settings, preview, revalidation, forms, redirects, or frontend integration.
